# CamerAscii

CamerAscii is an android app which lets the user convert images to ASCII art.
The user can either select a image from the gallery, or get a live preview from the camera.

# Features:
- Change quality/size of the output
- Change brightness
- Save the images to the clipboard
- Main menu screen
- Live conversion what the camera sees
- Turn on flashlight
- Choose pictures from the gallery instead of using the camera
- Rotate pictures chosen from the gallery
- Swap black pixels with white pixels

# Conclusion
- Camera is difficult to access (permissions ect)
- Used camera instead of android.hardware.camera2, lots of deprecated lines
- Android Studio works great with GIT
- Conversion works smoothly on smartphones, good quality on emulator is a bit laggy
- Overall all features got implemented
- Features work better than expected :)
